## Nuclear Facilities in the US
### Description: 
This map catalogs the nuclear reactors in the US by type: Pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs). 
It is to be noted that many facilities house more than one reactor but most commonly the reactors will be of the same type.
### Functions: 
The map uses bivariate symbology to represent the two types of reactors. Interactions include popups which display the facility name.
